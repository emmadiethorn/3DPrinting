# 3DPrinting for electrode protective caps
The .print file is in a format suitable for our printer, a Replicator+ printer accessed through Princeton University's Makerspace. Alternative caps were also designed by Princeton University's Princeton Neuroscience Institute Engineering & Design Team. These are the .stl files, and there are separate files for the base (i.e. the nut) and the top of the cap.
